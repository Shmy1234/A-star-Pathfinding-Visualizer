# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Running
From the project root (the folder that contains the `pathfinder/` directory):

```sh
javac $(find pathfinder -name "*.java")
java pathfinder.Game
```

Do not `cd` into `pathfinder/` before compiling; the Java packages assume the project root as the classpath base.
